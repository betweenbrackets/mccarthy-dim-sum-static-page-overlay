<!-- NOTES on my dim sum project -->
<!-- I began with this project https://betweenbrackets.github.io/recipe-card-static-page/ -->
<!-- and redesigned it to this project towards my love of dim sum. -->
<!-- I updated the pallette, the images, and the text. -->
<!-- Issue: the dim sum recipes were longer than the previous recipes and exceeded the styling: there was no white background, just gray text on the pale yellow background. -->
<!-- I updated the style rules to address this. -->
<!-- Issue: I updated the styles so that the recipes' overflow scrolled, but did not like the clunky user-side experience. -->
<!-- I updated to an overlay after searching for what might be available in hover, display: block, and display: none. I discovered w3schools how to. What a great find!-->
<!-- Issue: the overlay called only the first recipe. -->
<!-- I updated the id = "overlay", the functions, and the styles to be dish specific. -->
<!-- Issue: the overlay for steamed pork buns exceeded the browser due to the length of the directions. -->
<!-- I added a height to the styles to enable a scroll bar. -->

<!-- Moving forward: I find this to be "heavy code" in that there is a lot of repetition within the HTML. How do I update this? An array in the JavaScript? React props to diff the DOM? A Python list with an SQL database? PHP modules that I call in to a file? JSON? But, how would the recipes line out as objects? Stay tuned. This has been a great weekend project in June of 2020! -->

                                        <li>Combine sugar, salt, white, pepper, soy sauce, oyster sauce and water in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
                                        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions and cook, stirring constantly, for about a minute. Add the char siu and stir well. Add the soy sauce and oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes, until the pork is heated through.</li>
                                        <li>Add the Shaoxing rice wine to the dissolved cornstarch. Add the wine and cornstarch mixture to the warm pork and cook, stirring constantly, for another minute until the mixture has come together into a mass that you can mound. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool at room temperature before using.</li>
                                        <li>Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water and set aside for 1 minute to soften. Whisk in the oil to blend and dissolve the yeast. Set aside.</li>
                                        <li>Combine sugar, baking powder and flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Slowly stir with a wooden spoon, moving from the center toward the rim, to work in all the flour. Keep stirring as a ragged but soft dough forms. Then use your fingers to gather and pat the dough together into a ball. Transfer to a clean work surface and knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic.</li>
                                        <li>Place the dough in a large bowl that has been lightly oiled. Cover with plastic wrap and put it in a warm, draft-free place to rise for 45 minutes until the dough has nearly doubled.</li>
                                        <li>Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Cut the dough in half and roll into a foot-long log. Cut the log into eight pieces.</li>

                                        <li>Roll each piece into a ball and flatten gently into a small disc. Using a small rolling pin roll the edges and only the edges. There should be a small bulge at the center of the dough.</li>
                                        <li>Place a tablespoon of the char siu filling in the center of the dough. Wrap the filling by pressing and pulling the edges of the dough. Gather the edges and twist the top to fully cover the filling.</li>
                                        <li>Place each bun on a square of wax paper before steaming. Steam the buns in a bamboo steamer for 15 minutes, being careful to leave 1-2 inches between each.</li>
